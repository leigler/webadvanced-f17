# Web Advanced: Javascript

This course will focus on extending studentsâ€™ knowledge of code to web and cloud. Students will be learning JavaScript, the programming language of the Web. StudentsÂ will be introduced to a varietyÂ ofÂ applicationsÂ from user interactions, dynamic content organization, APIs, and the creation of desktop and mobile applications. We will look critically at the medium of software, dive into the cultural literature of web design, explore research and learning techniques, and develop a strong understanding for contemporary workflows and processes.

## Projects {projects}

### 1. Homepage {homepage}
#### (Due Sept 8)
Your first assignment will have two key elements: _Index_ and _Hello, world_. 

_Index_: Take the github page that you set up in todayâ€™s class and convert it into a living index of your work over this semester.  Think about how this index will grow (is it a list of text-based hyperlinks? photos? patterns?, does each link look different than the next? What underlying system dictates how the page is formatted?).

_Hello, world_: For the first link on your index, design and program a [_hello, world_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) site. Find a piece of content whose copyright has expired, or that is under a creative commons license (resources include [ubuweb](http://www.ubu.com/), [archive.org](https://archive.org/), and [EncyclopÃ©die Diderot](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/)).  This content should somehow be meaningful to you. Using your knowledge of HTML and CSS (and Javascript ðŸ™ƒ), design and program a re-publishing/remixing/re-interpreting of your content  that communicates your perspective and why you find this piece meaningful. This site should be multi-paged.*
